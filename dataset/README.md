The recursive graph (rmat) datasets are generated by the script located at ```dataset```, and the format is edge list which is shown below.

**Edge list file format:**
```
<vertex id> <vertex id>
```

The property of vertices and the property of edges are __32-bit__ value (can be integer of float type). During the entire processing flow the id of vertices is unsigned __32-bit__ integer.
